# Music Mixing Engine üéµ

A **real-time** music mixing engine that combines stems from different songs with smart memory management.

## Features Added:

  1. Beat Quantization System
    - Master timeline with global beat tracking
    - Quantized stem loading waits for next beat boundary
    - Configurable resolution: 1, 2, 4, or 8 beats
  2. Instant Playback Methods
    - instant.<stem> <song> - immediate playback with looping
    - sample.<stem> <song> - one-shot samples without looping
    - sync on/off - enable/disable quantization
    - quantize <1|2|4|8> - set resolution
    - sync status - show current sync state
  3. Smart Timing Logic
    - Default: beat-quantized loading for tight mixes
    - Override: instant modes for manual timing control
    - Threading-based delayed execution for perfect timing

  How It Works:

  - Quantized Mode (Default): When you load a stem with a.bass 2, it calculates
  the delay until the next beat boundary and schedules playback
  - Instant Mode: Commands like instant.bass 2 bypass timing and play immediately
  - Sample Mode: Commands like sample.vocals 1 fire one-shot sounds instantly
  without looping

  The system provides professional DJ-style synchronization while maintaining the
  flexibility for creative timing control.

## Features

- **Real-Time Audio Mixing**: Live stem playback via SuperCollider audio server
- **Smart Memory Loading**: Only loads stems when playing (optimized for 16GB RAM)
- **Individual Stem Control**: Mix bass from one song with drums from another
- **Section-Based Playback**: Play specific sections (verse, chorus, bridge, etc.)
- **High-Quality Audio**: 44.1kHz matching, no resampling degradation
- **OSC Control**: External control via OSC messages


### üéõÔ∏è Mixing Capabilities
- **Stem Separation**: Works with bass, drums, vocals, piano, and other stems
- **Song Structure Analysis**: Understands verse, chorus, bridge, intro, outro sections  
- **Intelligent Stem Selection**: Different strategies per mixing theme
- **Time-stretching Detection**: Identifies when pitch/tempo adjustment needed

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** for a reliable stems separation use demucs/spleeter and for song structure [allinone](https://github.com/hordiales/all-in-one) (which also does stems split using demucs)

## Usage

### üéõÔ∏è **Real-Time Smart Mixer (Recommended)**

**üöÄ One-Click Python Mixer (Easiest):**
```bash
./start_python_mixer.sh
```
*Automatically starts both Python audio server and stem mixer*

**Live Mixing Commands:**
```bash
üéõÔ∏èüß† > songs                    # List available songs
üéõÔ∏èüß† > a.bass 2                # Load bass from song 2 to deck A
üéõÔ∏èüß† > b.vocals.chorus 5       # Load vocals from chorus of song 5 to deck B
üéõÔ∏èüß† > bpm 128                 # Set BPM to 128
üéõÔ∏èüß† > cross 0.5               # 50/50 crossfade between decks
üéõÔ∏èüß† > bass 0.8                # Set bass volume to 80%
üéõÔ∏èüß† > random                  # Generate random creative mix
```
